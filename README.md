## Features

- **Food Rescue**: This feature allows users to locate and rescue surplus food from local restaurants and grocery stores, helping to reduce food waste and feed those in need.

- **Workshop**: A platform within the app where users can find and enroll in various workshops related to food sustainability, preparation, and nutrition.

- **Authentication**: A secure authentication system that enables users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts within the app.
